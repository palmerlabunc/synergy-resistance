# Relationship between synergy and resistance in combination cancer therapy

This repository includes all of the code used to run the simulations of the relationship between synergy resistance and generate the associated figures in the article. Below is a summary of each script. 

* `exponential.py` simulates a checkerboard as a specified level of synergy and plots the relationship between excess bliss and fitness benefit for each point in the checkboard. 
* `increasing synergy.py` simulates checkerboards at multiple levels of synergy and plots the relationship between level of synergy and median fitness benefit across the checkerboard.
* 
* `figures.py` generates representative isobologram plots for three different levels of synergy
